# Learnings

## 1. Stack

- When poping or peeking always check if the stack is empty or not.
- sometimes pairing two elements in the stack isnt a bad idea.
- you may easily pair elements using list comprehension with zip.
- when computing answers on the stack the result might be top or lenght of stack
- think about how sorting might help if you might have to resort to n^2

## 2. Python
- method overloading is not a thing in python
- look into kwargs and args for multiple inputs
- look into unpacking of variables
